About OpenACS XoWiki :

<p><p><p><p>XoWiki is a full-blown Wiki with MediaWiki syntax as an add-on to ]project-open[. It allows to complement structured information about <a href="/en/object-type-im-project">projects</a>, <a href="/en/object-type-im-company">companies</a> and other ]po[ objects with free-text and multimedia objects. One ]po[ system may have more than one XoWiki, and every XoWikis can have a different configuration and different access permissions. For example, you can setup a public &quot;Marketing Wiki&quot; and a second &quot;Employee Wiki&quot; for internal purposes only.
